    "Explaination": "Loose coupling between services can also be done through asynchronous integration. It involves onecomponent that generates events and another that consumes them. The two components do not integratethrough direct point-to-point interaction, but usually through an intermediate durable storage layer. Thisapproach decouples the two components and introduces additional resiliency. So, for example, if aprocess that is reading messages from the queue fails, messages can still be added to the queue to beprocessed when the system recovers.https://www.botmetric.com/blog/aws-cloud-architecture-design-principles/",
