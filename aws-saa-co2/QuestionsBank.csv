The gateway supports the following volume configurations: Gateway-cached volumes ?You store your data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and retain a copy of frequently accessed data subsets locally. Gateway-cached volumes offer a substantial cost savings on primary storage and minimize the need to scale your storage on- premises. You also retain low-latency access to your frequently accessed data. Gateway-stored volumes ?If you need low-latency access to your entire data set, you can configure your on- premises gateway to store all your data locally and then asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of this data to Amazon S3. This configuration provides durable and inexpensive off-site backups that you can recover to your local data center or Amazon EC2.

Which of the below mentioned options is recommended by AWS with respect to the selection of the availability zone?,Always select the AZ while launching an instance,Always select the US-East-1-a zone for HA,Do not select the AZ; instead let AWS select the AZ,The user can never select the availability zone while launching an instance,,C,"When launching an instance with EC2, AWS recommends not to select the availability zone (AZ). AWS specifies that the default Availability Zone should be accepted. This is because it enables AWS to select the best Availability Zone based on the system health and available capacity. If the user launches additional instances, only then an Availability Zone should be specified. This is to specify the same or different AZ from the running instances.
